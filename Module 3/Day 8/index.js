// Why do we need the Command Line?
// Wether you are front-end, back-end, or full stack - we use it to run and modify the commands
// There are some programs that only run through the Terminal


// A quick Note on the Node Project:
// * Why would we use node over the browser?
// * In the case of the weather api, we may want to do some data analytics, or store and collect weather information, or send emails about the weather, 
// or automate something based on the weather, or send daily text alerts - none of that would happen in the browser
